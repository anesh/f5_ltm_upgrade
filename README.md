## F5 LTM HA pair upgrade Automation

### Description

- the script gathers ucs and qkview from both the device pairs and uploads to an SFTP server defind by environment variables
- it then gathers the state of all the VIPs and Pools from  both device pairs and stores the files locally
- It stores the state of the active volumes from both devices
- it identifies the active device and saves the running config and does a verify load to check for config errors
- it then proceeds to find the standby device and install the image on a inactive volume
- once installation of image is complete it proceeds to reboot to volume with new image
- once the device is up and the mcpd is up, it checks the state of vips/pools with the pre-check, if there are differences
it stops the upgrade, if no differences are identified it proceeds with the next device
